# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a visualizer for multiple pathfinding algorithms. In essence, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points. Additionally, this visualizer can recursively generate maze structures which creates navigational obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms, effectively simulating a map application navigating the obstacles of a complex highway system or a puzzling urban sprawl.

## Motivation

I built this web-app because I was curious how map applications worked and wanted to visualize their algorithms. Also, this project was partially inspired by Clément Mihailescu’s informative and entertaining [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g) videos.

## Algorithms

All the algorithms on this visualizer are adapted to a two-dimensional grid, where ninety degree turns and movements from one node to another have a calculated cost of one. Furthermore, algorithms are either weighted or unweighted, and their weightedness dictates consideration of the afore mentioned cost calculations. What’s more, not all algorithms guarantee the shortest path, so be sure to read their descriptions to understand capabilities.
