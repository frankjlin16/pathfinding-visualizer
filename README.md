Welcome to my pathfinding visualizer! I built this web-app because I was curious how map applications worked and wanted to visualize their algorithms. In essence, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points, and this web-app is capable of visualizing multiple algorithms. Additionally, this visualizer can recursively generate maze structures which creates navigational obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms, effectively simulating a map application navigating the obstacles of a complex highway system or a puzzling urban sprawl.

## Algorithms

All of the algorithms on this visualizer are adapted to a two-dimensional grid, where ninety degree turns and movements from one node to another have a cost of one. Furthermore, algorithms are either weighted or unweighted, and this weightedness dictates consideration of the afore mentioned costs. Whatâ€™s more, not all algorithms guarantee the shortest path, so be sure to read their respective descriptions to understand capabilities.
